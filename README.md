The aim of this project is to build a model that finds extremely rare cases of credit card fraud from a dataset that is highly unbalanced due to the rarity of fraud cases. The classification model will be built using Keras and applied to unbalanced datasets. The main goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately classify fraud cases from normal cases on an imbalanced dataset. Due to the unbalanced dataset models accuracy is very high, which does not mean much, but the goal is to get true positives as low as possible and then reduce false positives. I'm currently building a hyperparameter tuner and will update this project when it's ready.
