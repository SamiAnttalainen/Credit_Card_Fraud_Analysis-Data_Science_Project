In this project the goal is to build a model that finds extremely rare credit card fraud cases from the dataset that is very imbalanced. Classification modeling is done with Tensorflow's Deep Learning classification modeling on imbalanced datasets. The project's main goal is to make a model that can classify accurately fraud cases from normal cases on imbalanced data set. Due to imbalanced dataset models accuracy is very high, which does not mean much, but the goal is to get true positives as low as possible and then lowering false positives. I'm currently building hyperparameter tuner and i'll update thise project when it is ready.
