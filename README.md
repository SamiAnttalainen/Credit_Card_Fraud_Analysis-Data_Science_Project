Project analyzes credit card data and tries to find main features that suggest fraud might be the case. Classification modeling is done with Tensorflow's Deep Learning classification modeling on imbalanced datasets. The project's main goal is to make a model that can classify accurately fraud cases from normal cases on imbalanced data set.
